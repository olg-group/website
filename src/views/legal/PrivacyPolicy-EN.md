## Hosting
Our hosting provider collects the following data, which your browser transmits, in so-called log files:
* Your IP address

* Date and time of the request
* Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time
* Content of the request
* HTTP status code

The collection of this data is necessary to ensure the stability and security of our website and corresponds to our 
legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f of the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR).

No tracking takes place, and we do not have direct access to the data mentioned. Instead, we receive only an anonymized, 
statistical summary, which includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page accessed, 
and the number of unique visitors. This data is not merged with other data.

For the provision of our website, we use the hosting service of:

GitHub is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest in accordance with 
Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, not having to maintain our own server. The server location is in the USA.

You have the right to object to the processing of your data. The likelihood of success of an objection will be 
determined within the scope of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of processing no longer applies.

The processing of the data mentioned in this section is neither legally nor contractually required. However, 
the functionality of the website is not guaranteed without processing.
